# Focus

Hides level difficulties

## Compatibility note

This mod just changes the difficulty sprite frame and star/orb labels to hide their contents
instead of making new nodes to override the old ones,
so it shouldn't cause breaking effects with many other mods.
However, this somewhat weak approach can be overriden fairly easily, 
as with the mods Demonify and Demons in Between.
These incompatibilities have been specified but the enabled toggle in settings should work.
