Hides level difficulties

---

Ever find yourself thinking too much about a level's rating?

Can't seem to reason why a level is Hard Demon when it should be Insane Demon?

Try using this mod with a myriad of options to help you **focus** on the level itself!

## Options

- Hide level difficulties, stars, and orbs
- Use classic demons instead of demon difficulties
- Reveal difficulties manually or when completing levels
